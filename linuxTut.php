    <h1>LINUX</h1>
    <h2>A simple guide on how to post a website with Linux:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Select a web hosting provider that supports Linux. There are numerous hosting services that support Linux,
            including Bluehost, HostGator, and SiteGround.</li>
            <img src="assets\img\Bluehost.png" alt="Bluehost app.">
        <li>Choose a name for your website's domain. This is the URL that visitors will use to access your website. A
            domain name can be registered with a domain registrar such as Namecheap or GoDaddy.</li>
        <li>Create a web hosting account. This will entail signing up for your preferred hosting service and hosting
            your website on their servers.</li>
        <li>Upload the files for your website to the server. You can upload your files to the server using an FTP client
            such as FileZilla. Upload all of your website's files, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any images or
            other media.</li>
            <img src="assets\img\filezilla.png" alt="FileZilla in Ubuntu.">
        <li>Configure the settings for your website. This includes creating your website's database, configuring your
            web server, and creating any necessary email accounts.</li>
        <li>Put your website to the test. Once your website has been uploaded and configured, test it to ensure that
            everything is in working order. You can do this by using a web browser to access your website.</li>
        <li>Launch your website. When you are happy with your website, you can publish it for all to see.
            Congratulations on successfully publishing your website with Linux!</li>
