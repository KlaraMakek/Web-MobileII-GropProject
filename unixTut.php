    <h2>UNIX Tutorial for Beginners</h2>
    <p>You have arrived at the UNIX tutorial for beginners. Because of its dependability and flexibility, UNIX is a
        strong operating system that is utilized in many industries. We will go over the fundamentals of UNIX in this
        tutorial, including the command line interface, file system administration, and process administration.
    </p>
    <h2>Getting Going</h2>
    <p>You will need access to a UNIX environment to get started. This could be a virtual or physical machine. On a
        Windows computer, you can also use a UNIX shell emulator like Git Bash or Cygwin.</p>
    <h2>An interface for the command line</h2>
    <p>The main means of communication with UNIX is through the command line interface. Open the terminal program to
        start the command line interface. The command prompt, where commands can be entered, will then appear.
    </p>
    <h2>File System Administration</h2>
    <p>On UNIX, all files and directories are kept in the file system. You can use commands like cd to switch
        directories, ls to list a directory's contents, and mkdir to create a new directory in order to navigate the
        file system.</p>
    <h2>Process Management</h2>
    <p>UNIX's process management system enables you to run multiple processes at once. Use commands like ps to list
        active processes, kill to end a process, and top to keep track of system resources if you want to manage
        processes.</p>
    <h2>Exercises and Examples</h2>
    <p>Here are some examples and exercises to help you put what you've learned into practice:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>- To move to a specific directory, use the cd command.</li>
        <li>- To list a directory's contents, use the ls command.</li>
        <li>- Create a new directory by using the mkdir command.</li>
        <li>- To view a list of active processes, use the ps command.</li>
        <li>- To end a process, use the kill command.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The fundamentals of UNIX, including the command line interface, file system administration, and process
        administration, have been covered in this tutorial. You will be well on your way to learning UNIX if you can
        master these ideas.</p>
