    <h2>Linux Security Principles</h2>
    <p>At all stages of setting up your Linux computer, security should be a top priority. Implementing a good security
        policy on a machine necessitates a solid understanding of Linux fundamentals as well as some of the applications
        and protocols that are used.</p>
    <p>Linux security is a vast subject with numerous complete books on the subject. I couldn't include everything in
        this tutorial, but it does provide a basic overview of security and how techniques and tools can be used to
        provide additional security on a Linux computer. Hopefully, this will provide enough information to investigate
        other sources of information.</p>

    <p>Despite the fact that Linux users are less vulnerable to viruses than users of other major operating systems,
        there are still many security issues that Linux users and administrators must deal with.</p>
    <p>Identifying why you are doing something is one of the most important steps in any task. Rather than simply
        stating that a system must be secure, you must consider what is meant by secure, what risks are associated with
        any data that is available, and what impact your security measures will have on your users. How else will you
        know if you've met your goal of making a system secure if you don't first consider any of these factors?</p>
